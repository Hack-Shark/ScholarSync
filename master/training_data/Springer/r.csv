introduction and references should be chosen appropriately according to the nature of paper 1 Review paper Cuttingedge review paper in a specific field of plasma physics The review should presents the current status of a given topic worldwide not limited to authorcollaborators own works It should provide historical backgrounds and literature survey but also be a critical distillation of the progress on the topic identifying the most successful methods and pointing out areas for future development Author should give considerable attention to introductions for graduate students and readers from other plasma physics fields Guideline of total words and pages are 25000 words and 50 pages but shorter and longer paper is acceptable if the review covers above criterion for full review 2 Special Topics Brief review article that focuses on a specific topic Its purpose is to highlight emerging research subjects recent advances in a specific area andor new research techniques It can also focus on the authors own work or experimental instruments As such we especially encourage early career physicists to submit Special Topics articles Guideline of total words and pages are 15000 words and 30 pages but shorter and longer paper is acceptable if the review covers above criterion References Since the scope is much narrower than Review a focused set of references eg the authors group works are allowed but a set of other key references to clarify the relative significance in the field should be included 3 Tutorial paper Tutorial review intended for introduction for students and physicists in other field Author should give considerable attention to offer insights and concepts and not go into mathematical details Guideline of total words and pages are 10000 words and 20 pages but shorter and longer paper is acceptable if the review covers above criterion 4 History Article which address historical development in plasma physics and its applications Historical development that illuminates 1 our understanding of modern plasma physics 2 development of experimental ideas and facilities for plasma physics discovery 3 interaction of plasma physics with mathematics and other natural science 4 development of national project involving plasma physics Paper can be structured as memorial of one or a few outstanding plasma physicists 5 Chandrasekhar Lecture Review lecture specialized for Laureate of AAPPSDPPs S Chandrasekhar Prize The lecture is intended for lecture on Laureates outstanding contribution to plasma physics Laureate can also choose recent work related to his works if one wishes 6 Plasma Innovation Lecture Review lecture specialized for Laureate of AAPPSDPPs Plasma Innovation Prize The lecture is intended for lecture on Laureates outstanding
