Quality Quantity;Quality Quantity Methodology of the Social Sciences Social Sciences general;Quality and Quantity constitutes a point of reference for European and nonEuropean scholars to discuss instruments of methodology for more rigorous scientific results in the social sciences In the era of biggish data the journal also provides a publication venue for data scientists who are interested in proposing a new indicator to measure the latent aspects of social cultural and political events Rather than leaning towards one specific methodological school the journal publishes papers on a mixed method of quantitative and qualitative data Furthermore the journals key aim is to tackle some methodological pluralism across research cultures In this context the journal is open to papers addressing some general logic of empirical research and analysis of the validity and verification of social laws Thus The journal accepts papers on science metrics and publication ethics and their related issues affecting methodological practices among researchers Quality and Quantity is an interdisciplinary journal which systematically correlates disciplines such as data and information sciences with the other humanities and social sciences The journal extends discussion of interesting contributions in methodology to scholars worldwide to promote the scientific development of social research This journal has occasional calls for papers please refer to the updates section at the bottom of the page for more information 96 of authors who answered a survey reported that they would definitely or probably publish in the journal again
