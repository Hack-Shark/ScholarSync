Tropical Plant Biology;Tropical Plant Biology Plant Sciences Plant Genetics and Genomics Plant BreedingBiotechnology Plant Ecology Transgenics;Tropical Plant Biology covers rapidly advancing aspects of tropical plant biology including physiology evolution development cellular and molecular biology genetics genomics genomic ecology and molecular breeding It presents articles of original research and review articles and publishes occasional special issues focused on a single tropical crop species or breakthrough Tropical Plant Biology fills a void in current publications it is the singular major journal specifically aimed at reporting advances in the science of all tropical plant related fields It is a repository of knowledge intended for use by geneticists physiologists agronomists breeders other scientists and managers to develop improved plants and practices to increase crop productivity and utilization Praise for Tropical Plant Biology Michael Freeling Professor University of California Berkeley a member of the National Academy of Sciences USA So much of evolutionary innovation happened in the tropics and is still happening In plants so often the basal genera of successful lineages the outgroups are represented today by a few tropical species and understanding these is necessary to understand origins and the biological meanings within our evergrowing sequence databases Additionally there are so many economically important tropical species It is my pleasure to endorse the niche journal Tropical Plant Biology as a timely and useful addition to our biology journals and the Springer family The leadership of Ray Ming and Paul Moore co EditorsinChief should ensure high quality at the launch Im looking forward to pointing my browser at Tropical Plant Biology Steven D Tanksley Professor Cornell University a member of the National Academy of Sciences USA Tropical species represent a major part of agricultural and international trade As genomic sequencing and the tools of genomics spread to tropical species there will be the need for a high quality journal to handle the many reports that will be forthcoming Tropical Plant Biology is posed to fill this niche and should thus be highly successful Covers rapidly advancing aspects of tropical plant biology Topics include physiology evolution development cellular and molecular biology genetics genomics genomic ecology and molecular breeding Reports significant advances in all aspects of tropical plant biology
