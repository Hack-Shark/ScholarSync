in Arbeits und Privatleben als auch dem Ruf nach Professionalisierung des Berufsfeldes Rechnung Coaching wird als eigenstndiger Beratungstyp im Sinne von professioneller Prozessberatung mit Fokus auf primr berufliche Anliegen wie zB im FhrungskrfteCoaching oder BusinessCoaching verstanden allerdings werden auch andere Formate des Coachings wie etwa Schreibcoaching oder Gesundheitscoaching miteinbezogen Auch digitale Formate ECoaching und virtuelle Beratungsrume spielen neben PrsenzCoaching verstrkt eine Rolle Die Zeitschrift spiegelt die dynamische Entwicklung und Wechselbeziehung von

Bildungswissenschaften die Soziologie ua Die Zeitschrift ist dabei offen fr disziplinre aber auch interdisziplinre und transdisziplinre Erforschung von Coaching und bercksichtigt dadurch die Komplexitt des Forschungsgegenstandes und die Anforderungen der Praxis Ziel ist es die Coachingforschung als Disziplin weiter zu etablieren von anderen helfenden Berufen abzugrenzen und dessen

digitalen Formaten etc Aims Scope The journal Coaching Theory Practice offers a theoretically and empirically sound evidencebased perspective on the personal and professional development format coaching The journal thereby responds to an increasing societal demand for coaching in a personal and professional context and contributes to the professionalization and theoretical legitimation of the field Coaching is defined as a processoriented development format of its own which principally addresses professional concerns as found for instance in executive or business coaching However also other foci such as health coaching or the coaching of writing processes are included in this definition Additionally digital formats ecoaching and virtual spaces play an increasingly important role apart from facetoface coaching consultations As the title suggests the journal reflects the dynamic developments and interplay between research and practice in the context of coaching Its aim is to build a bridge by fostering evidencebase and practiceoriented quality control and by encouraging continuous exchange between theory and practice Articles published in Coaching Theory Practice are thus not only of interest to scholars researchers junior scientists professors instructors students but also to practitioners coaches coordinators of coaching programs and trainings HR experts who want to engage with the latest scientific findings and advancements The journal shares its singular focus with the international coaching congress Coaching meets Research Both platforms seek to establish coaching research while maintaining a strong connection to coaching practice In 2020 due to these convergent goals and existing synergies the journal and the coaching congress decided to pool their strengths a positive development for both as well as the entire coaching community The collaboration between Coaching meets Research and Coaching Theory Practice thereby mirrors how scientific knowledge is generated in a continuous exchange with practical experience Current issues in the context of coaching are presented and considered from a science and practice perspective researchers and practitioners first discuss their results in conference talks or papers which are then submitted and after thorough peer review published in suitable journals These presentations and the resulting publications make an important contribution to the current coaching landscape and its professionalization Both congress and journal create a space for reallife and virtual as well as theoretical and thematic exchange to take place In this way they give home to a scientifically oriented coaching community Though originally situated in the field of occupational and organizational psychology the journal is open to contributions from all disciplines which theoretically andor empirically engage with coaching Apart from psychology this includes disciplines such as linguistics economics pedagogy sociology etc The journal is open to disciplinary but also inter and transdisciplinary research on coaching in order to honour the complexity of the subject matter and the requirements in practice The aim is to further establish coaching as a research field to differentiate it from other helping professional formats and to feed the research findings back into coaching practice In terms of methodologies Coaching Theory Practice offers a platform for quantitative qualitative and mixed methods approaches alike and publishes highquality original articles concerned with basic or applied research as well as theoretical discussions of definitions concepts theories models or approaches to coaching etc For manuscripts to be published a clearly defined research interest and question combined with adequate methodological or theoretical proceedings as well as a critical discussion of the results and implication in relation to the field of coaching research are essential The majority of contributions are original articles which may be submitted in German or English The manuscripts are reviewed by two independent experts from the respective subdiscipline in a doubleblind peer review process The journal is available digitally articles are open access and published according to an online first principle Thematically the journal is open to all relevant innovative and current research questions At the same time topical collections have been established in 2020 which enable the continuous publication of manuscripts on certain selected themes Possible types of contributions include but are not limited to outcome or changeprocess studies processoutcomestudies case studies pilot studies the development of diagnostic instruments or theories thematic reviews

Cognition Technology Work;Cognition Technology Work User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction Industrial and Organizational Psychology Cognitive Psychology Automotive Engineering Aerospace Technology and Astronautics MedicinePublic Health general;Focus Cognition Technology Work focuses on the practical issues of human interaction with technology within the context of work and in particular how human cognition affects and is affected by work and working conditions The aim is to publish research that normally resides on the borderline between people technology and organisations Including how people use information technology how experience and expertise develop through work and how incidents and accidents are due to the interaction between individual technical and organisational factors The target is thus the study of people at work from a cognitive systems engineering and sociotechnical systems perspective The most relevant working contexts of interest to CTW are those where the impact of modern technologies on people at work is particularly important for the users involved as well as for the effects on the environment and plants Modern society has come to depend on the safe and efficient functioning of a multitude of technological systems as diverse as industrial production transportation communication supply of energy information and materials health and finance In particular the working contexts where such impact is most relevant are amongst others aviation rail maritime and road systems medical and hospital environments energy production and nuclear power plants household and social contexts plus other contexts where popular technology is being constantly utilised for everyday activities The journal will also study how operators interact with technologies such as pilots drivers plant and traffic controllers maintenance engineers doctors and nurses etc while also including the users affected by the systems such as passengers patients and people in general Motivation Human work has irreversibly become work with technology and the nature of work has changed to make the role of human cognition more important In the most affected environments the human component is relevant both for the interactions of humans with control systems and for the effects that these interactions may have on the general public at large People who work with technology are tightly coupled with it and must come to terms with the complexity of the sociotechnical environment in order to ensure that their work is effective safe and efficient Consequently understanding and analysing the joint functioning of people and sociotechnical development operation and maintenance systems is the first key motivation of the studies proposed by CTW This requires a multidisciplinary approach which combines the analysis of individuals with the study of technology and organisations The second relevant motivation of CTW is that methods and methodologies proposed and applied in field studies must be able to be reproduced and implemented by readers in order to be really effective and useful Therefore the peculiarity of combining consolidated theoretical frameworks with relevant implementations in real working contexts and the assessment of results is essential for reaching the impact necessary to maintain the Journal at the edge of applied research and practical implementation that represent the major aim of CTW

Journal of Robotic Surgery;Journal of Robotic Surgery Minimally Invasive Surgery Surgery Urology;Surgery has traditionally been a specialty within the medical profession that has revolved around invasive procedures to treat various maladies Initially trauma induced by the therapeutic procedure was necessary and reasonable to provide benefit to the patient But now through the innovation of digital imaging technology combined with optical engineering and improved video displays surgeons can operate inside of body cavities for therapeutic intervention without the larger incisions previously necessary to allow a surgeons hands access to the necessary organs Rather than creating large incisions several inches long to gain access to underlying tissues minimally invasive surgical techniques typically rely on small halfinch incisions encircling the surgical field in order to insert small scopes and instruments Minimally invasive surgery has caused a change in the route of access and has significantly and irrevocably changed the surgical treatment of most disease processes Patients still undergo interventions to treat disease but minimally invasive surgery makes possible a reduction or complete elimination of the collateral damage required to gain access to the organ requiring surgery While the benefits of this approach were numerous for the patient early technology limited the application of minimally invasive surgery to some procedures Specifically surgeons using standard minimally invasive techniques lost the value of a natural three dimensional image depth perception and articulated movements Magnification of small structures was often difficult and instruments were rigid and without joints Robotic surgery has provided the technology to address these limitations and allow the application of minimally invasive surgery to a broader spectrum of patients and their diseases Surgical robots relieve some of these limitations by providing fine motor control magnified three dimensional imaging and articulated instruments The use of r obotics in surgery is now broadbased across multiple surgical specialties and will undoubtedly expand over the next decades as new technical innovations and techniques increase the applicability of its use Tracks the progress of new robotic surgery techniques Reports on innovative equipment and new procedures Explores fine motor control threedimensional magnified imaging and articulated instruments

Safety in Extreme Environments;Safety in Extreme Environments Environmental Science and Engineering Quality Control Reliability Safety and Risk Offshore Engineering Environmental Health;Provides a special focus to the field safety of human activity in extreme environments Offers a unique platform for research from different disciplines such as engineering natural sciences medicine psychology social sciences and resource development The aim of this international peerreviewed journal is to provide an interdisciplinary platform for safety related aspects of human activity in extreme environments It thereby enables researchers professionals students decision makers and safety responsible from different areas to identify common problems and challenges and helps solving them Extreme environments are often characterized by high or excessive exposure to cold heat pressure vacuum voltage corrosive chemicals particle and electromagnetic radiation shock moisture or contamination Remoteness isolation and extreme working conditions together with a high degree of uncertainty often come along with these conditions Human activities in those extreme environments such as polar regions space deep sea high altitudes and deserts require therefore a special focus on the safety and the risk of such activities It is therefore necessary to stimulate crossdisciplinary research and collaboration to develop new knowledge and share information for safe human activity The journal invites original research reviews short communications and case studies from different disciplines such as engineering natural sciences medicine psychology social sciences and resource development A special focus is given to the field safety of human activity in extreme environment Due to its unique content the journal serves as important source of information for researchers professionals and decision makers in the fields of polar operations space offshore military deep sea and high altitudes CALL FOR PAPERS Special Issue on Environment Health and Safety EHS Management during Natural Resources Development in Extreme Environments A significant portion of human activities in extreme environments are intended to develop natural resources Due to the increasing global energy demand this portion keeps increasing Operators are keen to learn how to progress their operations safely and environmental friendly while regulators are eager to establish proper regulations standards and guidelines to ensure safety and environmental issues are well managed in locations with harsh environments which are often characterized by high or excessive exposure to cold or hot climate pressure flammable or explosive materials corrosive chemicals etc Industrial activities in extreme environments present significant technical and logistical challenges in the engineering design construction and operation of onshore and offshore infrastructure and facilities These locations eg the Arctic and subArctic regions the deserts and underground sites are usually remote and with limited resources available for emergency responses Lack of knowledge and data adds more challenge and uncertainty to the determination of whether engineering specifications are sufficiently defined to ensure the safe and environmentalfriendly operations in harsh conditions Further complications arise as engineering schemes fall increasingly under technological economic environmental and human constraints Intensive and extensive research is needed to provide sufficient knowledge for safety assurance and environmental protection in extreme environments For the aforementioned reasons the special issue aims to consolidate the literature on safety and environmental issues related to natural resources development in extreme environments and provide an overview of the stateofart of these issues and potential solutions This special issue invites original papers dealing with but not limited to the following topics Process safety in extreme environments Occupational safety in extreme environments Human factor challenges in extremes environments Corrosion prevention and control in extreme environments Innovation in data collection and remote monitoring Risk assessment with scarce information New materials for application in extreme environments Environmental management in extreme environments Pollution control and mitigation in extreme environments Modeling of oil spills in cold waters Submission Guidelines Original submissions of highquality contributions are expected Please

Zeitschrift fr Erziehungswissenschaft;Zeitschrift fr Erziehungswissenschaft Education general Pedagogic Psychology Educational Policy and Politics Sociology of Education;Forum der wichtigen internationalen und interdisziplinren Entwicklungen aus Erziehung und Bildung Die Zeitschrift fr Erziehungswissenschaft ZfE ist ein reprsentatives wissenschaftliches Fachorgan fr die gesamte Erziehungswissenschaft Sie publiziert von Experten im doubleblind PeerReviewVerfahren begutachtete erstklassige empirische als auch theoretischkonzeptionelle Beitrge ber aktuelle wissenschaftliche Entwicklungen und bietet Interessenten an professionellem erziehungswissenschaftlichem Wissen interdisziplinre Forschungsergebnisse Durch die Auswahl der Herausgeber und Herausgeberinnen des Beirats und besonders durch die Themenwahl steht sie fr den interdisziplinren Charakter einer umfassenden Erziehungswissenschaft deren Gegenstand der gesamte Lebenslauf des Menschen ist Das Team der Herausgeber wurde so zusammengestellt dass eine hohe Pluralitt hinsichtlich wissenschaftstheoretischer Orientierungen der vertretenen Fachrichtungen der Nachbardisziplinen und der Sicherung internationaler Entwicklungen gewhrleistet ist Die ZfE berschreitet daher die traditionellen disziplinren Grenzen und verffentlicht Beitrge aus allen Bereichen der Erziehungswissenschaft sowie den angrenzenden Gebieten der Philosophie Geschichte Anthropologie Psychologie Bildungssoziologie und Bildungskonomie Sie ermglicht durch die gezielte Aufnahme internationaler englischsprachiger Beitrge einen Anschluss an die wissenschaftlichen Entwicklungen auerhalb Deutschlands Die Leser und Leserinnen der Zeitschrift verfgen somit ber ein Periodikum das ihnen die fr Erziehung und Bildung wichtigen internationalen und interdisziplinren Entwicklungen in weiten Bereichen der Erziehungswissenschaft zuverlssig nchtern und nachvollziehbar prsentiert Warum wurde die Zeitschrift fr Erziehungswissenschaft gegrndet Seit Ende des 20 Jahrhunderts hat sich die Situation der Erziehungswissenschaft grundlegend verndert Erziehungswissenschaft ist in Deutschland das zweitgrte Universittsfach Sie hat sich seit der Mitte des 20 Jahrhunderts etabliert professionalisiert und sie bietet ein breites Spektrum von Forschungsfeldern Sie gliedert sich inzwischen in 25 Subdisziplinen und Fachrichtungen deren Bedarf an bergreifenden fr alle Zweige wichtigen wissenschaftlichen Resultaten betrchtlich ist Personell steht das Fach in den Universitten und Hochschulen vor grundlegenden Vernderungen die sich aus der personellen Erneuerung sowohl in der Folge der deutschen Wiedervereinigung als auch als Resultat des altersbedingten Ausscheidens von ber 60 des wissenschaftlichen Personals ergeben Die Erziehungswissenschaft ist keine Disziplin mehr die sich gegenber den Resultaten anderer Disziplinen verschliet und ein provinzielles Proprium entwickelt Sie ist vielmehr eine beispielhaft interdisziplinre Wissenschaft geworden die sich zunchst gegenber den Geisteswissenschaften dann gegenber den Sozialwissenschaften produktiv geffnet hat und dieses nunmehr auch gegenber den Naturwissenschaften unternimmt Der europische Einigungsprozess hat erziehungswissenschaftliche Makrostrukturen wie die European Educational Research Association EERA hervorgerufen es laufen zahlreiche innereuropische Kooperationsprojekte und es besteht ein groes Interesse an der deutschen Erziehungswissenschaft im osteuropischen und asiatischen Raum Unter diesen Bedingungen ist ein wachsender Bedarf an internationalen wissenschaftlichen Resultaten in der Erziehungswissenschaft zu verzeichnen Erziehungswissenschaft ist nicht lnger mehr nur eine Disziplin die sich mit der Erziehung und Unterrichtung von Kindern befasst Die Ausweitung pdagogischer Interventionen im gesamten Lebenslauf ist in den zurckliegenden Jahrzehnten konsequent durchgefhrt worden Gegenstand der Erziehungswissenschaft ist heute der gesamte Lebenslauf des modernen Menschen Diese und weitere epochale Entwicklungen im Erziehungs und Bildungssystem sowie in den korrespondierenden Disziplinen verlangten konsequenterweise nach einem neuen Publikationsorgan in dem die divergenten Tendenzen konzentriert zur Darstellung gebracht werden knnen Erstmals erschienen im Frhjahr 1998 war die ZfE die erste erziehungswissenschaftliche Zeitschrift in Deutschland die das DoppelBlindPeerReview eingefhrt hatte Diese in anderen sozialwissenschaftlichen Disziplinen und im englischsprachigen Ausland selbstverstndliche Praxis des Peer Review dient der Qualittssicherung Mittlerweile ist die ZfE in der Fachcommunity bestens eingefhrt und erfreut sich gesteigerter Reputation Die Zeitschrift wird im Social Science Citation Index gelistet Das Profil der Zeitschrift fr Erziehungswissenschaft Bei der Grndung der Zeitschrift fr Erziehungswissenschaft haben die oben genannten der neuen Rahmenbedingungen am Ausgang des 20 Jahrhunderts eine besondere Rolle gespielt Sie haben zu folgenden Leitlinien der Zeitschrift fr Erziehungswissenschaft gefhrt ffnung von qualitativ hochstehender Forschung fr breite Rezipientenkreise Bekenntnis zur Interdisziplinaritt der Erziehungswissenschaft und Verzicht auf pdagogische Provinzialitt konsequente ffnung fr die internationale Entwicklung von Educational Research Schaffung eines Forums fr divergente wissenschaftliche Beschftigungen mit Erziehungs Bildungs und Sozialisationsvorgngen im gesamten Lebenslauf des modernen Menschen
