GEM International Journal on Geomathematics;GEM International Journal on Geomathematics Applications of Mathematics Earth Sciences general Computational Science and Engineering;As in many areas of science mathematics has also gained an unprecedented importance in geosciences The complexity of the processes within the Earth at its surface and in the atmosphere can only be described modelled mapped and understood by means of modern mathematical methodologies GEM The International Journal on Geomathematics encourages interdisciplinary research in this respect It publishes high quality peerreviewed mathematical papers which are also relevant in Earth sciences This includes all kinds of mathematical methodologies algebraic analytic computational numerical operatortheoretic optimizationbased statistical stochastic etc in every possible discipline of geosciences such as but not exclusively climatology exploration fractured porous media modelling geodynamics geology geomagnetics hydrology oceanography satellite data analysis seismology solid Earth physics and time series analysis but also planetary sciences and cosmology While GEM is a mathematical journal we also welcome research papers from applied scientists who present innovations or enhancements for the mathematical techniques in their expertise Moreover we interpret geomathematics in the broader sense that also mathematical novelties for other applications but with applicability in Earth sciences are appreciated There are numerous areas of applied mathematics with strong interrelations with geomathematics such as fluid dynamics and medical imaging just to mention a few Furthermore we also strongly encourage the submission of survey articles which build bridges between geosciences and mathematics
