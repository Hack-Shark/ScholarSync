this journal for more detail The quarterly journal publishes research methodology and software articles as well as editorials comments and book and software reviews Review articles of relevant findings topics and methodologies are also considered Research Technology and Education Objectives ESIN will help to develop and shape the new field of Earth Science Informatics It is intended to provide a dissemination platform for research using systemsbased approaches to solve multiscale Earth science problems by encouraging the development of robust formal and computational models and information systems Since Earth Science Informatics is a new field just now emerging there is little precedence how to formally educate traditional domain knowledgeoriented scientists and engineers to become informaticists and also how to effectively integrate cyberinfrastructure into Earth science education The Earth Science Informatics journal will act as a venue to share experiences and concepts for educational approaches to accomplish the training of the next generation of Earth science informaticists as well as bringing cyberinfrastructure into the scholarly and graduatelevel education Rationale for the Journal Earth Science Informatics is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field with the potential to have a significant impact on the advancement of Earth system science by deriving new knowledge about the Earth system through formal informationrich and semanticbased approaches Analysis and understanding of complex Earth phenomena and processes necessitate the integration of field experimental theoretical and computation research through informatics Information on Open Research Funding and Support may be found here
