Mathematics and Financial Economics;Mathematics and Financial Economics Quantitative Finance Finance general MacroeconomicsMonetary EconomicsFinancial Economics Economic TheoryQuantitative EconomicsMathematical Methods Applications of Mathematics Statistics for Business Management Economics Finance Insurance;In the last twenty years mathematical finance has developed independently from economic theory and largely as a branch of probability theory and stochastic analysis This has led to important developments eg in asset pricing theory and interestrate modeling This direction of research however can be viewed as somewhat removed from realworld considerations and increasingly many academics in the field agree over the necessity of returning to foundational economic issues Mainstream finance on the other hand has often considered interesting economic problems but finance journals typically pay less attention to the highlevel quantitative approach When quantitative methods useful to economists are developed by mathematicians and published in mathematical journals they often remain unknown and confined to a very specific readership More generally there is a need for bridges between these disciplines The aim of this journal is to reconcile these two approaches and to provide the bridging links between mathematics economics and finance Typical areas of interest include foundational issues in asset pricing financial markets equilibrium insurance models portfolio management quantitative risk management intertemporal economics uncertainty and information in finance models History The first EditorinChief was Elys Jouini 2007 succeeded by Ivar Ekeland 2011 and from 2014 by Ulrich Horst and Frank Riedel jointly
