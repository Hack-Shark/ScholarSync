in Arbeits und Privatleben als auch dem Ruf nach Professionalisierung des Berufsfeldes Rechnung Coaching wird als eigenstndiger Beratungstyp im Sinne von professioneller Prozessberatung mit Fokus auf primr berufliche Anliegen wie zB im FhrungskrfteCoaching oder BusinessCoaching verstanden allerdings werden auch andere Formate des Coachings wie etwa Schreibcoaching oder Gesundheitscoaching miteinbezogen Auch digitale Formate ECoaching und virtuelle Beratungsrume spielen neben PrsenzCoaching verstrkt eine Rolle Die Zeitschrift spiegelt die dynamische Entwicklung und Wechselbeziehung von

Bildungswissenschaften die Soziologie ua Die Zeitschrift ist dabei offen fr disziplinre aber auch interdisziplinre und transdisziplinre Erforschung von Coaching und bercksichtigt dadurch die Komplexitt des Forschungsgegenstandes und die Anforderungen der Praxis Ziel ist es die Coachingforschung als Disziplin weiter zu etablieren von anderen helfenden Berufen abzugrenzen und dessen Ergebnisse in die Praxis zurckzuspielen Methodisch bietet Coaching Theorie Praxis sowohl quantitativen als auch qualitativen und mixedmethods Anstzen eine Plattform und verffentlicht qualitativ

digitalen Formaten etc Aims Scope The journal Coaching Theory Practice offers a theoretically and empirically sound evidencebased perspective on the personal and professional development format coaching The journal thereby responds to an increasing societal demand for coaching in a personal and professional context and contributes to the professionalization and theoretical legitimation of the field Coaching is defined as a processoriented development format of its own which principally addresses professional concerns as found for instance in executive or business coaching However also other foci such as health coaching or the coaching of writing processes are included in this definition Additionally digital formats ecoaching and virtual spaces play an increasingly important role apart from facetoface coaching consultations As the title suggests the journal reflects the dynamic developments and interplay between research and practice in the context of coaching Its aim is to build a bridge by fostering evidencebase and practiceoriented quality control and by encouraging continuous exchange between theory and practice Articles published in Coaching Theory Practice are thus not only of interest to scholars researchers junior scientists professors instructors students but also to practitioners coaches coordinators of coaching programs and trainings HR experts who want to engage with the latest scientific findings and advancements The journal shares its singular focus with the international coaching congress Coaching meets Research Both platforms seek to establish coaching research while maintaining a strong connection to coaching practice In 2020 due to these convergent goals and existing synergies the journal and the coaching congress decided to pool their strengths a positive development for both as well as the entire coaching community The collaboration between Coaching meets Research and Coaching Theory Practice thereby mirrors how scientific knowledge is generated in a continuous exchange with practical experience Current issues in the context of coaching are presented and considered from a science and practice perspective researchers and practitioners first discuss their results in conference talks or papers which are then submitted and after thorough peer review published in suitable journals These presentations and the resulting publications make an important contribution to the current coaching landscape and its professionalization Both congress and journal create a space for reallife and virtual as well as theoretical and thematic exchange to take place In this way they give home to a scientifically oriented coaching community Though originally situated in the field of occupational and organizational psychology the journal is open to contributions from all disciplines which theoretically andor empirically engage with coaching Apart from psychology this includes disciplines such as linguistics economics pedagogy sociology etc The journal is open to disciplinary but also inter and transdisciplinary research on coaching in order to honour the complexity of the subject matter and the requirements in practice The aim is to further establish coaching as a research field to differentiate it from other helping professional formats and to feed the research findings back into coaching practice In terms of methodologies Coaching Theory Practice offers a platform for quantitative qualitative and mixed methods approaches alike and publishes highquality original articles concerned with basic or applied research as well as theoretical discussions of definitions concepts theories models or approaches to coaching etc For manuscripts to be published a clearly defined research interest and question combined with adequate methodological or theoretical proceedings as well as a critical discussion of the results and implication in relation to the field of coaching research are essential The majority of contributions are original articles which may be submitted in German or English The manuscripts are reviewed by two independent experts from the respective subdiscipline in a doubleblind peer review process The journal is available digitally articles are open access and published according to an online first principle Thematically the journal is open to all relevant innovative and current research questions At the same time topical collections have been established in 2020 which enable the continuous publication of manuscripts on certain selected themes Possible types of contributions include but are not limited to outcome or changeprocess studies processoutcomestudies case studies pilot studies the development of diagnostic instruments or theories thematic reviews

Cognition Technology Work;Cognition Technology Work User Interfaces and Human Computer Interaction Industrial and Organizational Psychology Cognitive Psychology Automotive Engineering Aerospace Technology and Astronautics MedicinePublic Health general;Focus Cognition Technology Work focuses on the practical issues of human interaction with technology within the context of work and in particular how human cognition affects and is affected by work and working conditions The aim is to publish research that normally resides on the borderline between people technology and organisations Including how people use information technology how experience and expertise develop through work and how incidents and accidents are due to the interaction between individual technical and organisational factors The target is thus the study of people at work from a cognitive systems engineering and sociotechnical systems perspective The most relevant working contexts of interest to CTW are those where the impact of modern technologies on people at work is particularly important for the users involved as well as for the effects on the environment and plants Modern society has come to depend on the safe and efficient functioning of a multitude of technological systems as diverse as industrial production transportation communication supply of energy information and materials health and finance In particular the working contexts where such impact is most relevant are amongst others aviation rail maritime and road systems medical and hospital environments energy production and nuclear power plants household and social contexts plus other contexts where popular technology is being constantly utilised for everyday activities The journal will also study how operators interact with technologies such as pilots drivers plant and traffic controllers maintenance engineers doctors and nurses etc while also including the users affected by the systems such as passengers patients and people in general Motivation Human work has irreversibly become work with technology and the nature of work has changed to make the role of human cognition more important In the most affected environments the human component is relevant both for the interactions of humans with control systems and for the effects that these interactions may have on the general public at large People who work with technology are tightly coupled with it and must come to terms with the complexity of the sociotechnical environment in order to ensure that their work is effective safe and efficient Consequently understanding and analysing the joint functioning of people and sociotechnical development operation and maintenance systems is the first key motivation of the studies proposed by CTW This requires a multidisciplinary approach which combines the analysis of individuals with the study of technology and organisations The second relevant motivation of CTW is that methods and methodologies proposed and applied in field studies must be able to be reproduced and implemented by readers in order to be really effective and useful Therefore the peculiarity of combining consolidated theoretical frameworks with relevant implementations in real working contexts and the assessment of results is essential for reaching the impact necessary to maintain the Journal at the edge of applied research and practical implementation that represent the major aim of CTW
