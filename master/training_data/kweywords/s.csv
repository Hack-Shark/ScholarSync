Safety in Extreme Environments;Safety in Extreme Environments Environmental Science and Engineering Quality Control Reliability Safety and Risk Offshore Engineering Environmental Health;Provides a special focus to the field safety of human activity in extreme environments Offers a unique platform for research from different disciplines such as engineering natural sciences medicine psychology social sciences and resource development The aim of this international peerreviewed journal is to provide an interdisciplinary platform for safety related aspects of human activity in extreme environments It thereby enables researchers professionals students decision makers and safety responsible from different areas to identify common problems and challenges and helps solving them Extreme environments are often characterized by high or excessive exposure to cold heat pressure vacuum voltage corrosive chemicals particle and electromagnetic radiation shock moisture or contamination Remoteness isolation and extreme working conditions together with a high degree of uncertainty often come along with these conditions Human activities in those extreme environments such as polar regions space deep sea high altitudes and deserts require therefore a special focus on the safety and the risk of such activities It is therefore necessary to stimulate crossdisciplinary research and collaboration to develop new knowledge and share information for safe human activity The journal invites original research reviews short communications and case studies from different disciplines such as engineering natural sciences medicine psychology social sciences and resource development A special focus is given to the field safety of human activity in extreme environment Due to its unique content the journal serves as important source of information for researchers professionals and decision makers in the fields of polar operations space offshore military deep sea and high altitudes CALL FOR PAPERS Special Issue on Environment Health and Safety EHS Management during Natural Resources Development in Extreme Environments A significant portion of human activities in extreme environments are intended to develop natural resources Due to the increasing global energy demand this portion keeps increasing Operators are keen to learn how to progress their operations safely and environmental friendly while regulators are eager to establish proper regulations standards and guidelines to ensure safety and environmental issues are well managed in locations with harsh environments which are often characterized by high or excessive exposure to cold or hot climate pressure flammable or explosive materials corrosive chemicals etc Industrial activities in extreme environments present significant technical and logistical challenges in the engineering design construction and operation of onshore and offshore infrastructure and facilities These locations eg the Arctic and subArctic regions the deserts and underground sites are usually remote and with limited resources available for emergency responses Lack of knowledge and data adds more challenge and uncertainty to the determination of whether engineering specifications are sufficiently defined to ensure the safe and environmentalfriendly operations in harsh conditions Further complications arise as engineering schemes fall increasingly under technological economic environmental and human constraints Intensive and extensive research is needed to provide sufficient knowledge for safety assurance and environmental protection in extreme environments For the aforementioned reasons the special issue aims to consolidate the literature on safety and environmental issues related to natural resources development in extreme environments and provide an overview of the stateofart of these issues and potential solutions This special issue invites original papers dealing with but not limited to the following topics Process safety in extreme environments Occupational safety in extreme environments Human factor challenges in extremes environments Corrosion prevention and control in extreme environments Innovation in data collection and remote monitoring Risk assessment with scarce information New materials for application in extreme environments Environmental management in extreme environments Pollution control and mitigation in extreme environments Modeling of oil spills in cold waters Submission Guidelines Original submissions of highquality contributions are expected Please submit your manuscript as an Original Research Article via httpswwwspringercom42797 and select the special issue Safety Assurance and Environmental ProtectionSAEP in the Additional Information section during the submission process The format of all submissions should follow the specifications described in Guide for Authors of the Journal of Safety in Extreme Environments shown in httpswwwspringercom42797 Papers will be refereed according to the procedures and standards of the journal Each paper will undergo a thorough evaluation by at least two reviewers The authors will have some time to incorporate the comments of the reviewers and submit a revised version of their papers which will be evaluated again by the reviewers to make a final decision Editors Ming Yang Nazarbayev
