Waste and Biomass Valorization;Waste and Biomass Valorization Engineering general Environment general Renewable and Green Energy Industrial Pollution Prevention Waste ManagementWaste Technology Environmental EngineeringBiotechnology;Until the 1990s technology was the main driver when dealing with waste and residues the objective being the treatment of waste for landfill disposal storage and in some cases sorting In the 1990s depletion of raw materials and socioeconomical concerns supported the direct recycling of waste and residues However the direct recycling approach is limited when wasteresidues contain significant amounts of pollutants such as heavy metals and organics VOC PAH and when the treatment process to removestabilize or destruct the pollutant generates emissions Due to depletion of natural resources increasing greenhouse emissions and awareness of the need for sustainable development in terms of safely reusing waste and biomass the transformation of wastebiomass to valuable materials and energy ie valorization is emerging as a strong trend Waste Biomass Valorization is the first journal dedicated solely to waste and biomass valorization As such an opportunity exists for a new journal dedicated to the valorization via chemical thermal biological or electrochemical treatments of waste and biomass to materials and energy as opposed to the treatment of waste and biomass for eliminationdestruction 93 of authors who answered a survey reported that they would definitely publish or probably publish in the journal again
